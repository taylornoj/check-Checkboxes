# Check Checkboxes

Day 10 of the [JavaScript 30 challenge](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30)!

The task today was to recreate a common layout you would see in an email client.  When a user clicks a checkbox, holds Shift and then clicks another checkbox a few rows above or below, all the inbetween checkboxes will be checked also.

## What I learned:
- the .shiftKey keyboard event that reads true when pressed and false when not during the event
- the checkbox .checked property
- more experience working with flag variables
